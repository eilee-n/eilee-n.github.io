  <h1>Welcome to Debug</h1>
  <div class = "middletext">We are Debug, a nonprofit organization born out of a desire to defy what is taught to be possible for young women, especially in the world of STEM (specifically in Technology). Girls lack the resources and environment to envision themselves as leaders and active members, leading to a gender gap in STEM everywhere, from high school clubs to professional workplaces. Debug aims to have technical and educational events, build up a network of mentors and role models, and create a supportive environment in order to empower each young woman with confidence in her identity and a burning passion to change the world.</div>
